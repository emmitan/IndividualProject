# Bloom

**About**: A simple, fun, and relaxing game, where you grow different plants to create a garden in a clicker-game based style. Each new 'level' will bring you to a new series of plants (basic flowers, herbs, vegetables, fruits, and exotic plants) that takes you a step closer to completing your garden.

**To-Do List (Code):**
- Create classes for: different plant series, garden decorations (money), fairies
- Start coding for the first plant series and main
- Find out where to create graphics

**References:** videos, links, etc.
