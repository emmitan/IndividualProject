# IndividualProject

**About**: A simple, fun, and relaxing game, where you grow different plants to create a garden in a clicker-game based style. Each new 'level' will bring you to a new series of plants (basic flowers, herbs, vegetables, fruits, and exotic plants) that takes you a step closer to completing your garden.

**brainstorm:**
- clicker game but you grow different flowers, every time you fully grow one flower, it changes to a different plant > fixed amount of plants you can grow, once it's done it has ending message then you grow a garden
- TENTATIVE (only if i know how to do it) each click = inc. in money, can use to buy fertilizer, pesticides, etc. that will speed up the growing proccess? OR money can be used to buy decorations: garden gnomes, birdbaths, etc.
- can't buy diff. flowers/plants, have to click through the different series (basic flowers, herbs, vegetables, fruits, exotic plants)
- little garden fairies that give encouraging messages throughout the game (can be random or with each plant, probably latter)
- need to create different classes for each plant series, perhaps consummables if i'm doing them, fairies (timer? if they show up at random/specific time)
- methods for game starting, ending, finished growing, new plant, when the fairies would appear

**To-Do List (Code):**
- Create classes for: different plant series, garden decorations (money), fairies
- Start coding for the first plant series and main
- Find out where to create graphics
